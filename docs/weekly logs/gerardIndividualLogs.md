##Week4 (Sept.25, 2023 - Oct.1, 2023)
###Goals Recap
-My goals this week was to complete the team project plan, and from the tech stack decided, start downloading and setting up my system as soon as possible, in order to be able to start working on other features. 
###Tasks on board
-This week I helped finish the project plan, I completed the project overview and as a team we all worked on the features that would be present in the project. I also started downloading the required softwares and started setting up my system.

###Completed vs InProgress
- The project plan is completed but the system set up is still in progress.

###Context
I believe this week helped us familiarize with how the project will advance and the priorities that we will have
