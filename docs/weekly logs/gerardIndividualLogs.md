## Week5 (Oct.2, 2023 - Oct.8, 2023)
### Goals Recap
- My goals these week were focused on learning the web framework django. And having set up everyones system so that everyone can work efficiently using github. I learned a lot about Django, but I believe that the systems will still need some work as I only know that two of our systems work.
### Tasks on board
- My tasks are the login, logout and auth for the website and learning django. I already created a fully functioning login, logout and registration system that will be the base for our project using Django.

### Completed vs InProgress
- Login, logout and auth task still needs some work to be completely finished, but learning Django has been completed

### Context
I believe this week was really stressfull, as I believed that my team knew which framework we were gonna use, and I could just jump in from that, as I have no knowledge in web programming, but apparently they had no idea so I had to decide on which one we were going to use and learn it from zero.
